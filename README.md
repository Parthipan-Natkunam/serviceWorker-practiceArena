## ServiceWorkers <img src="/img/logo.png">

Note:
-----
All my repositories with a "playArena" logo means that they are not open source projects but are rather learning projects that I use to learn certain technology/language/feature, etc. in a very hands-on way.
This is a standard tagging system that I have come up with to distinguish such repos from actual open source works of mine. This system is followed in all my repo Readme files in order to manage them easily and also to make the visitors quickly understand a repo's purpose.
Please be aware that my older learning repos may not adhere to this system, but all future ones will do. 

### Description:

The folder contains practice code used for learninng serviceWorkers the hands-on way.
