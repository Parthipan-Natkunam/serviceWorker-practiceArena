## ServiceWorkers-PlayArena

Note:
-----
All my repositories with a "-playArena" means that they are not open source projects but are rather learning projects
that I use to learn certain technology/language/feature, etc. in a very hands-on way.
This is a standard nomenclature that I have come up with to distinguish such repos from actual open source works of mine. This nomenclature is followed in all my repo naming in order to manage them easily and also to make the visitors quickly understand a repo's purpose.
Please be aware that my older learning methods may not adhere to this nomenclature, but all future ones will do. 

### Description:

The folder contains practice code used for learninng serviceWorkers the hands-on way.
